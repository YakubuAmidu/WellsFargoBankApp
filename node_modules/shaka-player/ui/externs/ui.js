 * @property {boolean} clearBufferOnQualityChange
 *   Only applicable if the resolution selection is part of the UI.
 *   Whether buffer should be cleared when changing resolution
 *   via UI. Clearing buffer would result in immidiate change of quality,
 *   but playback may flicker/stall for a sec as the content in new
 *   resolution is being buffered. Not clearing the buffer will mean

 *   at the start of the seek bar as played (using the "played" color).

 *   cannot easily do this in pure CSS.
 * @property {shaka.extern.UIVolumeBarColors} volumeBarColors
 *   The CSS colors applied to the volume bar.  This allows you to override the
 *   colors used in the linear gradient constructed in JavaScript, since you
 *   cannot do this in pure CSS.
 * @property {shaka.ui.TrackLabelFormat} trackLabelFormat
 *   An enum that determines what is shown in the labels for text track and
 *   audio variant selection.
 *   LANGUAGE means that only the language of the item is shown.
 *   ROLE means that only the role of the item is shown.
 *   LANGUAGE_ROLE means both are shown, or just language if there is no role.
 *   Defaults to LANGUAGE.
 * @property {number} fadeDelay
 *   The delay (in seconds) before fading out the controls once the user stops
 *   interacting with them.  We recommend setting this to 3 on your cast
 *   receiver UI.
 *   Defaults to 0.
 * @property {boolean} doubleClickForFullscreen
 *   Whether or not double-clicking on the UI should cause it to enter
 *   fullscreen.
